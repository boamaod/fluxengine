## Adjust configuration for a Shugart drive
<!-- This file is automatically generated. Do not edit. -->

This is an extension profile; adding this to the command line will configure
FluxEngine to adjust the pinout to work with a Shugart drive. This only works
on Greaseweazle hardware.

For example:

```
fluxengine read ibm --720 shugart_drive
```
