## Adjust configuration for a 40-track drive
<!-- This file is automatically generated. Do not edit. -->

This is an extension profile; adding this to the command line will configure
FluxEngine to read from 40-track, 48tpi 5.25" drives. You have to tell it because there is
no way to detect this automatically.

For example:

```
fluxengine read ibm --180 40track_drive
```
